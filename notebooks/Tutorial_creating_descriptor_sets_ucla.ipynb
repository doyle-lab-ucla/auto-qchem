You will also need to [install Auto-QChem](https://github.com/doyle-lab-ucla/auto-qchem/blob/master/Install.md) on your local computer with the required python packages. \n",

    "Given a string representation of a molecule, Auto-QChem generates 3D conformers and performs DFT calculations for them on a remote computing cluster. After monitoring that the calculations have finished, Auto-QChem collects the DFT features and stores them in a database accessible by a web interface. "
